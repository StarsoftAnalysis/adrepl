# adrepl

A simple REPL console for AxiDraw.

I've found that running AxiDraw commands from the command line is slow,
especially on an old Raspberry Pi B+,
so I wrote this wrapper using the Python API.

Run ```adrepl.py``` or ```python adrepl.py```, and then 
follow the prompts and enter commands to control the plotter.

## Commands

Some commands have synonyms to be consistent with the original axicli commands.  For example `x` and `walk_x` do the same thing.

home | walk_home
etc.

## Requirements

* Python 3.5 or later
